\begin{cvletter}

%------------------------------------------------

I found the advertisement for the support technician position through Indeed and was very interested. I have theoretical knowledge in computing obtained through studying Computer Science at the University of Queensland. In addition to my formal study I have learnt a lot through experimenting and my general interest in computers.

I have experience in building and troubleshooting problems with computers having built and managed three. I have experience in scripting to automate processes using both Bash and Python. My most complex system using a combination of Bash and Python to automate downloading and renaming files from an external server to my media server.

I am also a good communicator and team worker. Having been a Youth Group leader at my church for over a year. I've needed to have good communication skills to work with both my co-leaders and youth.

I have a lot of experience and interest in self learning. At the moment I am working through multiple books and other resources on the Comptia A+ certification. I want to pass the exams and get into the IT industry. I may not have experience with the specific tools or software that your team uses. However, with some training I will quickly be able to start using the tools and master them.

I would be very interested in working for an organization that aligns with my values. I believe I can bring a lot to the organization through the role of support technician.
